    <!-- In summary, map() transforms each element of an array, filter() removes elements from an array based on 
a condition, and reduce() transforms an array into a single value.


    map(): The map() method is used to create a new array by transforming each element of an existing 
    array based on a provided function. The original array is not modified. The map() method returns an 
    array with the same length as the original array. For example, you can use map() to convert an array 
    of numbers to an array of their squares.
    
    filter(): The filter() method is used to create a new array that contains only the elements of 
    an existing array that meet a certain condition based on a provided function. The original array 
    is not modified. The filter() method returns an array that can be shorter or the same length as 
    the original array. For example, you can use filter() to remove all the odd numbers from an array.
    
    reduce(): The reduce() method is used to transform an array into a single value based on a provided 
    function. The reduce() method takes an initial value and applies the provided function to the elements 
    of the array in a cumulative way, reducing them to a single value. The original array is not modified. 
    For example, you can use reduce() to calculate the sum of an array of numbers. -->
